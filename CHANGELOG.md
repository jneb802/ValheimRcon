### 1.5.2
- Show the online character name with the creator ID in player-built object results
- Updated player-list and armor-stand handling for Valheim 1.0
- Fixed player display names in the Valheim 1.0 player list
- Fixed Discord webhook messages and file uploads
- Added RCON chat relay support for solo and locally hosted games

### 1.5.1
- Added `-zone <x> <y>` parameter to `findObjects` and `deleteObjects` commands for searching/deleting objects by zone coordinates
- Added `-prefab <prefab name>` option to `modifyObject` command to change object prefab
- Added `-detailed` flag to `findObjects` command to show/hide detailed object information (like rotation, support, extra item information etc.)
- Fixed an issue when sending large files to Discord (could occur when using -findObjects if more than 100k objects were found and the file size exceeded 10mb, which exceeds Discord's file upload limit)
    - Such files are now not sent to Discord and are instead saved to disk on the server
- Improved object information display with better formatting and type-specific details
- Enhanced ZDO info system:
	- More detailed and structured object information display
	- For mod developers, the ability to add custom object information providers has been added. These will be used everywhere object information is displayed (e.g. findObjects, deleteObjects, etc.) - `ZDOInfoUtil.RegisterInfoProvider()`

### 1.5.0
- Added security improvements:
	- IP address filtering with CIDR mask support (whitelist/blacklist)
		- Configure allowed/blocked IP addresses or IP ranges using CIDR notation
		- Whitelist: if empty, all IPs allowed (except blacklisted)
		- Blacklist: always blocks specified IPs/ranges (takes priority over whitelist)
	- Security incident logging to Discord
		- Reports failed login attempts, unauthorized access, IP filter rejections, and other security events
		- Configurable webhook URL and message prefix for security reports
	- Empty password protection: plugin is disabled if password is empty to prevent insecure configurations

### 1.4.1
- Added container inventory management commands:
  - `showContainer <id:userid>` - display inventory contents with item indices `[index]` for each item
  - `addItemToContainer <id:userid> <item_name> [options]` - add items to container
    - options: `-count <count>` `-quality <quality>` `-variant <variant>` `-data <key> <value>` `-nocrafter` `-durability <durability>` `-force`
    - Default durability is set to maximum for the specified quality level
  - `removeItemFromContainer <id:userid> [options]` - remove items from container
    - options: `-index <index>` (recommended) or `-item <name>`, `-count <count>`, `-force`
    - Use `-index` to precisely target items when multiple items with the same name exist
  - `clearContainer <id:userid> [options]` - clear container inventory
    - options: `-force`
- Added `-durability <durability>` option to `give` command
  - Default durability is set to maximum for the specified quality level
  - Use `-durability` to override the default value

### 1.4.0
- Changed custom object tag ZDO key to avoid conflict with portal tag (breaking: existing tagged objects created with older versions will not be found by tag)
- Removed `findObjectsNear` command; use `findObjects -near <x> <y> <z> <radius>` instead
- Expanded `findObjects` with `-near` filter to search within a radius around a position
- Added `-tag-old <tag>` to `findObjects` to search objects that use the old tag key
- Added `modifyObject` command to modify properties of persistent objects
  - Supports changing position, rotation, health and custom tag
  - Will not modify non-persistent objects or objects owned by online players unless `-force` is used to bypass safety checks
  - Note: changes to position, rotation or health of objects currently owned by players may not be immediately visible to those players
- Added `disconnectAll` command to disconnect all connected players from the server
- Added Random Events commands:
  - `eventsList` - list all available random events
  - `startEvent <event_name> <x> <y> <z>` - start a random event at the specified position
  - `stopEvent` - stop the currently active random event
  - `currentEvent` - show the currently active random event and position

### 1.3.0
- deleteObjects: added `-force` flag to bypass safety checks; use with extreme caution as it can delete critical game objects (zones, dungeons, player models)
- Simplified object id to `id:userid` format

### 1.2.2
- Fixed rcon packet size limit issue (huge thanks to **ourbob** for finding the issue)

### 1.2.1
